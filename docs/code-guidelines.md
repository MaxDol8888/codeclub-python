Code Guidelines for Python CodeClub projects
====================================

Based on guesswork by Adrian and Pete Lewin and some limited discussion between us!

* Python 2.7 not 3.x.
  * Rationale: it's the path of least resistance. School PCs stand a higher chance of having it installed. Modules more likely to work.
* Tabs not spaces.
  * Ade is mostly a 'spaces' kind of guy, but pressing one key instead of 2, 4 or 8 means less opportunities for syntax mistakes.
* There should be a ```main``` function.
  * Rationale: Pete thinks it's a good idea. Ade's not sure of the rationale but I guess it's just normal practice in Python-land, so I'll go with it.
* It's OK for the kids to have to make derived classes, especially derived from ```Sprite```
  * Rationale: although this is seen as an advanced concept, kids are already familiar in Scratch with the concept of attaching scripts to objects.
