Teacher notes for Py06-ChatRoom
============================

[Student handout](student-handout.md)

Goals:

* Introduce networking
* Show that classes are not always sprites.
* Show that there's more to programming than just games (but non-game stuff can be fun too...)


Still to do before kids get near this!
------------

* Test it _actually_ works over a network!
* Figure out how to explain the awkward line which involves www.google.com, if needs be.
* Work out who runs the Pyro nameserver and who runs the room, in a typical classroom environment.
