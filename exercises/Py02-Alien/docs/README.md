Teacher notes for Py02-Alien
============================

[Student handout](py02-alien.md)

Goals:

* Ensure that the Python & IDE setup actually works at your school
* Get kids used to seeing code in the form of text
* Get them used to the idea that a lot of coding is about _reading_ code not writing it
* Introduce them to the idea of classes.

Things to point out:

* In Scratch, there's a single instance of each Sprite. In Python, there are 'classes' of sprites, and there may be several of each.
* Later we might come across classes of objects which are not actually visible on the screen, but not in this exercise
* Lots of the code will not be explained this time. Boilerplate. Explain why not.
** If you're feeling brave, you can explain the concept of a 'library' at this time.

Practical things:

* They can't break anything. Ensure they make a COPY of the exercise. This needs more thought.
