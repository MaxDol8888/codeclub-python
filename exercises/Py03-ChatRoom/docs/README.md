Teacher notes for Py03-ChatRoom
============================

[Student handout](py03-chatroom.md)

Goals:

* Introduce networking
* Show that classes are not always sprites.
* Show that there's more to programming than just games (but non-game stuff can be fun too...)


Still to do before kids get near this!
------------

* Make it actually work over a network by telling the Pyro daemon to bind to the network address not localhost.
