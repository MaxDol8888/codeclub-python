This exercise gives a very simple 'game' where you can move a ball around the screen.

For the first half of the exercise, you'll be copying out code to make the game work.

For the second half, there's a challenge.

Part One: Writing the game
--------------------------

Just do what the guide tells you!

Part Two: Challenge
-------------------

You can only move the ball left and right, using the left and right keys.

Improve the game so you can move it up and down as well.
