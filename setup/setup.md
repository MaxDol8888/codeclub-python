Setup for CodeClub Python Exercises
======================================

Dependencies
---------------

You need to install four things:

* [Python 2.7](http://www.python.org/getit/) - I use the [32-bit version on Windows](http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/python-2.7.3.msi)
* [PyGame 1.9.1](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml) - specifically use [this version](http://pygame.org/ftp/pygame-1.9.1.win32-py2.7.msi) if you're on Windows, with 32-bit Python 2.7 as suggested above
* [git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [PyCharm IDE](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) which is free for use in schools, but you'll need to fill in a form.

Check that you can access http://www.github.com _and_ https://www.github.com/

Teachers/guides: see [the rationale behind these decisions](rationale.md).
