Setup for CodeClub Python Exercises
======================================

Dependencies
---------------

You need:

* Python 2.7
* PyGame 1.9.1
* (Later) 'Bonjour' networking software. Specifically:
** On Windows you should install Bonjour for Windows.
** On Mac nothing is required.
** On Linux (including a Raspberry Pi) you should ensure 'avahi' is installed.
* PyBonjour (version not yet figured out)
* The PyCharm IDE which is free for use in schools.

Other things to do
--------------------

* Check that it all works together by doing the first exercise. Ensure in particular that you can edit and run games.

* Check that PyBonjour is working to enable computers on your school network to see one another. In due course we will write some test utility to make this possible...

Why I chose PyCharm
---------------------
I know nothing about Python IDEs, and I was told this was quite good. It mostly seems to 'just work' thus far.

Saving files so kids can continue to work on them from home
-------------------------------------------------------------

The obvious thing to use is probably github, since PyCharm has built-in git support, and it doesn't require us to install other software on the PCs. However I haven't really thought this through yet. If we did really want to do this, perhaps the code for the exercises should start off on github and get forked by the kids.
